I am a climate scientist specializing in global teleconnections, large-scale dynamics, and surface-atmosphere interactions. Currently, I serve as an Assistant Professor of Practice in the [Department of Earth and Environmental sciences](https://as.vanderbilt.edu/earth-environmental-sciences/) at Vanderbilt University. 

My previous work involved studying glacier dynamics using the [ICEPACK](https://icepack.github.io) model, developed by [Daniel Shapero](https://psc.apl.uw.edu/people/investigators/daniel-shapero/) at the [Polar Science Center](https://psc.apl.uw.edu), University of Washington. I also explored the impacts of glaciers and ice on atmospheric circulations and hydroclimate patterns at local and regional scales through the [NASA HiMAT](https://himat.org) project. Additionally, I contributed to the [MAGIC](https://www.glaciersealevel.com) project, , where I examined alpine glaciers' mass balance, their effects on global sea level rise, and the broader socioeconomic implications. 

My Ph.D. research under Prof. [Courtenay Strong](https://www.inscc.utah.edu/~strong/) in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah focused on (1) the influence of summertime atmospheric teleconnections on the North American Dipole (NAD), particularly in understanding how monsoonal and tropical convection drives large-scale climate circulations that impact continent-wide bird irruptions and forest seed masting; (2) the changes in mid-latitude [Rossby waves](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/rossby-wave.html) under future climate scenarios, which result in seasonal shifts of the NAD pattern; and (3) the interaction between climate and episodic or periodic biological-ecological events, such as the 10-year cyclic population dynamics observed in boreal seed-eating finches, as well as in more than 20 vertebrate species across the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., snowshoe hares and ruffed grouse).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
