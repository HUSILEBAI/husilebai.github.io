I am a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at University of Utah. Presently, I am studying glacier dynamics using the [Icepack](https://icepack.github.io) model. Additionally, I am investigating interactions between glaciers and atmosphere using the Weather Research & Forecasting model ([WRF](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf)).  

Previously, I studied the teleconnection mechanisms associated with ecologically-relevant climate dipole, using both historical observational analysis and Global Climate Model (GCM) boundary forcing experiments, mainly to understand how monsoonal and tropical convection drives continental-scale climate dipoles which impact the bird irruption and conifer seed masting over the boreal forest.

I am very insterested in climate variability and dynamics, climate modeling, cryosphere-atmosphere interactions, and glacier mass balance and dynamics.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
