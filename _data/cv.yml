    - title: Graduate Research Assistant
      institution: Department of Atmospheric Sciences, University of Utah
      year: 2019 - 2022
      description:
        - Committee - Drs. Courtenay Strong (Chair), John Horel, Jalene M. LaMontagne, Thomas R. Reichler, Benjamin Zuckerberg
        - Studied the interdisciplinary research covering climate, tree masting, and bird migration, mainly to understand the teleconnection mechanisems link to the continental-scale climate dipoles which influence the ecological-evolutionary processes, such as bird migration and conifer seed masting.
        - Conducted sea surface temeprature boundary forcing experiments using Community Earth System Model (CESM2.0), and mentored other graduate students in the lab on CESM process.
        - Using Matlab and Python for data analyzing
